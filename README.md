# Fire & Dough Pizza Co.

This is a **practice project** built while learning how to use **Tailwind CSS**.  
Itâ€™s a fictitious pizza restaurant landing page with sections like:

- Hero  
- Menu  
- About  
- Features  
- Testimonials  
- Gallery  
- Call to Action  
- Contact Form  
- Footer  

The goal is to practice modern web layout and styling using Tailwind utilities.
